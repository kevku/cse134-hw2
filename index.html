        <p>Hey there, I'm Bryson Collins. My fascination with all things mechanical led me to specialize in robotics, a dream I've had since I was a kid. Whether it's tinkering with Legos or developing cutting-edge robotic arms, I'm dedicated to making robots an integral part of our daily lives. my experience at the <span>University of California, San Diego (UCSD)</span> has been nothing short of transformative. UCSD has been the backdrop for my academic journey in mechanical engineering with a specialization in robotics, a field that has always fascinated me. It's here that I've had the opportunity to explore the inner workings of machines, learn from top-notch professors, and engage in hands-on projects that have deepened my understanding of this dynamic discipline. The academic rigor has been challenging, but it's precisely these challenges that have allowed me to grow, develop resilience, and become a more confident engineer. Beyond my studies, I've also found a vibrant gaming community, forming friendships and expanding my gaming skills in a competitive gaming club. UCSD has been the cornerstone of my growth, shaping not only my academic foundation but also my personal and professional aspirations. It's provided me with a nurturing environment where I can pave my way into the thrilling intersection of mechanical engineering and gaming technology, and I'm eager to see where this journey takes me.</p>
