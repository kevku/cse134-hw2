          <p>Prototyping "Spotty" the Delivery Dog at UCSD has been a thrilling and transformative experience. This project emerged from a desire to address urban delivery challenges while incorporating my passion for mechanical engineering with a specialization in robotics. The process involved designing, developing, testing, and refining a prototype that could autonomously navigate urban environments, delivering packages efficiently. The journey was filled with challenges and late nights of brainstorming, but it was also incredibly rewarding. Seeing "Spotty" successfully deliver packages during our public showcase was a defining moment. This experience has solidified my dedication to the field of robotics and my vision of contributing to the evolution of last-mile delivery solutions. The future for "Spotty" looks promising, and I'm excited to continue this innovative.</p>
